# cos301-team-delphi

Dependencies:

Umlet must be placed in the documentation directory for the makefile to compile diagrams.

See the projects tab for the current progress of the project

Checkout the wip(work in progress) branch for the most recent work

Workflow conventions:

1. Pull and compile before you push

2. In the projects tab, move work you want to work on from the TODO column into the In Progress column and assign yourself to the issue.

3. When complete, move your work from In Progress to the Review column to be reviewed and given feedback by a peer. After review, the peer will move the work to Done and close the issue.

3. Push bleeding edge work into wip

4. Merge each document version into master and label the version(we might not need this part)

5. Feature freeze will commence on March 11 12PM. The bulk of work should be done before then, only fixes to typesetting, formatting and other touchups will be done after this time. The idea is that the open issues should deflate to zero, as they are closed one for one, before the complete freeze. Complete freeze will commence 2 hours before the deadline, this means that nothing should be modified after this period. This is to prevent last minute changes having unintended consequences.
