While designing NavUP the following needs to be minimized as much as possible:


\paragraph{Memory}
\mbox{}\\
NavUP will be designed in such a way as to require minimal local storage on user`s phone while still keeping a cache that is sufficiently large for it to operate in offline mode. To accommodate lower end smartphones, the app should not use more than 400MB of ram at any point in time.

\paragraph{Data Usage}
\mbox{}\\
The Application will require little to non of the users data and will rather realy heavely on Wi-Fi arround campus. However, te app will not congest the Wi-Fi on campus either.

\paragraph{Battery Usage}
\mbox{}\\
Battery usage for the application and web service will be minimized and "eco-friendly" to all phones.

\paragraph{Cost}
\mbox{}\\
The system will require minimal costs, with most of the features self-made or freely available to all users.

\paragraph{Complexity}
\mbox{}\\
The user interface will be easy to user so that anybody can use it without difficulty. 
It will require little to no experience to enjoy all the features offered.
